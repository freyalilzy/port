## Persuasive Writing

**Helen Wilman’s “The Conquest of Poverty”: The roots and conflicts of impoverishment.**

Helen Wilman's "The Conquest of Poverty" (1899)[^1] is a semi-autobiographical, inspirational guide to overcoming impoverishment. It posits philosophical, New Thought questions concerning socioeconomic inequality. The author draws upon her subjective experiences to craft solutions for these issues. In the late 1800s, widespread economic insecurity meant that her practical framework for achieving financial stability had a receptive readership, mostly consisting of women and the working class.

A central theme in Wilman’s text is the psychological conflict between a fear-based mindset and the actualisation of one’s potential. This foregrounds her claim that poverty is a state which can be overcome through a mental transformation. Despite being a woman in repressive, nineteenth-century society, Wilman’s advocacy for autonomy are visibly modern.

Regardless of its age, the text retains significant contemporary relevance. Wilman's analysis positions education as being "the only cure for poverty" (p. 125)[^1], a claim which aligns closely with the modern emphasis on higher education as being a course to social mobility. A pioneer of Mental Science, Wilman echoes Descartes' assertion, "I think, therefore I am" (1637)[^2]. She further declares that man is "all mind" (p. 116)[^1], highlighting the importance of mentality in achieving self-actualisation.

Whilst Wilman's arguments are undeniably persuasive in her insistence that mindset is fundamental to the acquirement of "knowledge" (p.80)[^1] and conquering poverty, she risks overlooking the systemic barriers which limit participation in education. This was evident within the context of the 1800s, wherein women's access to university was limited (Royale, 2021)[^3]. It is still apparent today, with a lack of women in leadership positions after graduation (OECD, 2025)[^4] and low-income students facing significant barriers to education (Office for Students, 2023)[^5].

Wilman’s book serves to reinforce the importance of mentality in achieving academic success, although it is limited by its subjectivity and its lack of consideration for systemic obstacles which have and continue to affect low-income households today.
