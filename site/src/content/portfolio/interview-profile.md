**How much do finances and social participation impact student life at university?**

Universities present themselves as spaces wherein there are equal opportunities, and equal outcomes. However, students’ socio-economic background provides them with a discernible advantage, both socially and academically.

Naturally, there has been significant progress in the prospects afforded to lower-income students. In the second half of the 2000s, young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds became 30 percent likelier to enter higher education than the five years previously (Corver, 2010, p.12)[^2]. Yet, 41 percent of students said they'd considered dropped out for money-related concerns (NSMS, 2025)[^5]. This indicates that economic barriers can undermine retention in higher education, particularly amongst students from lower-income households.

Social participation also appears to be a factor in student retention. University loneliness reportedly leads two-thirds of affected students to consider dropping out (Aldermore, 2025)[^1]. Dean (2025)[^3] reports that the biggest concern for students at Swansea University was fitting in and feeling included. 

Bella, an ex-Swansea University student, ranked social factors as the biggest influence upon her decision to drop out. She was a first-generation student, who hadn’t initially planned to go to university. Bella says, “Initially, my flatmates seemed really welcoming. I didn’t concern myself with making other friends. After a couple of months, their real personalities began to show. One of them would suddenly become enraged and destroy things in our kitchen. The university didn’t do anything for six months. I didn’t even realise how stressed I was until I came home for Christmas and knew I couldn’t go back.”

This highlights the importance of flat dynamics in shaping social participation. Universities have a duty of care to their residents and should act on reports of hostile or unsafe living environments more quickly. For Bella, her university’s failure to do so led to a complete change of her lifestyle and future.

When asked to discuss financial factors, Bella states that her student loan is an ongoing regret. “I dropped out after one term, more than a year ago, and I’m still paying off my student debt. I don’t think I even registered how expensive university really is. If it was cheaper, I would have definitely re-applied somewhere else.”

Bella’s experience illustrates how university saddles students with a financial burden extending far beyond the classroom. Bella even admits that she was never certain she wanted to attend university, merely feeling “pressured” into it. Now, she is an example of a fundamental flaw in the system – she has been put into significant debt but has no degree to compensate for it. Higher income families can enable their children to take on the financial risk of university, with few consequences if the gamble doesn’t pay off.

Undergraduates, like myself, are continually acquiring debt for a minimum of three years. Whilst student loans can temporarily improve student life, that money must eventually be paid back. The stress of this has a lasting impact. For instance, Lindgren et al (2023)[^4] linked student loan debt, socioeconomic status and mental health symptoms together. They suggested that student loan can lead to problematic drinking, which recognisably has a negative impact on life span and overall wellbeing.

Another student I interviewed, Laila, stated that she had also dropped out of university, to pursue a different course at Exeter instead. She claimed that financial pressures were “too intense for her to continue her course abroad in Ireland. Another student from a lower-income background, she said that she “hadn’t predicted” the intense financial pressures which she would face, ultimately leading to her having to withdraw after the first term.
